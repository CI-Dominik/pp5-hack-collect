## **USER EXPERIENCE**

## Target audience
* The homepage's target audience are those who want to make their life easier by using normal household objects in a much more creative way. It is aimed towards people who want to do creative work. Those who like to tinker and bring more color into their life.

## User's journey
* The user is welcomed by the home page that displays a short summary of what they can expect. There, for logged-out users, a convenient sign-up button is placed in the hero area. If the user is already logged in, a button that takes them to the hack page is displayed instead to get them started immediately.
For easy access, a plus button is placed right next to the title link to add a hack. Once this site gets resized to mobile size, the button gets removed and placed in the navigation menu.

## Intuitive and consistent design
* A consistent layout was used throughout the homepage to ensure a coherent user experience. Every element is styled and placed for convenient access.
