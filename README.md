## **USER EXPERIENCE**

## Target audience
* The homepage's target audience are those who want to make their life easier by using normal household objects in a much more creative way. It is aimed towards people who want to do creative work. Those who like to tinker and bring more color into their life.

## User's journey
* The user is welcomed by the home page that displays a short summary of what they can expect. There, for logged-out users, a convenient sign-up button is placed in the hero area. If the user is already logged in, a button that takes them to the hack page is displayed instead to get them started immediately.
For easy access, a plus button is placed right next to the title link to add a hack. Once this site gets resized to mobile size, the button gets removed and placed in the navigation menu.

## Intuitive and consistent design
* A consistent layout was used throughout the homepage to ensure a coherent user experience. Every element is styled and placed for convenient access.

## **DESIGN**

## Color choice

## **USED PLATFORMS AND DEVICES**

## Browsers
* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox
* Microsoft Edge

## Smartphones
* Poco F5 Pro
* Samsung S21
* Samsung S23
* iPhone XS

## **BUGS**

## 401 authentication error
* An error occurs in the console displaying a 401 error when sending the authorization token. This is a known bug of Django Rest Framework and was not resolvable for me at the moment of completing the project. The site's functionality is not impacted by this.

![401 error](docs/bugs/401-error.jpg)

## WebSocket connection error
* After some time, a WebSocket error occurs in the console, even though no WebSocket was used. The error has no impact on the site's functionality.

![WebSocket error](docs/bugs/websocket-error.jpg)

## findDOMNode error
* Even with strict mode turned off, an error regarding the usage of findDOMNode appears when clicking the NavBar component's toggle icon. This is due to an ending support in future versions to warn the development team. It has no impact on the site's functionality.

## **ACCESSIBILITY**

## Lighthouse testing

### Mobile view
* xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

*xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx PAGE*

![Picture of the XXXXXXXXXX page's results](docs/lighthouse/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.jpg)

### Desktop view

*xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx PAGE*

![Picture of the XXXXXXXXXX page's results](docs/lighthouse/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.jpg)

## WAVE extension
* The WAVE extension in Google Chrome was used to determine the accessibility rating of the homepage. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

*xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx PAGE*

![Picture of the WAVE results for the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx page](docs/wave-extension/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.jpg)

## Goal of accessibility measures

* The goal of accessibility is the same result, performance and view of the content for any person, regardless of their condition. For example, the colors are chosen in a way that all people can use the site without any problems. The contrast needs to be high enough to read every text.<br>
